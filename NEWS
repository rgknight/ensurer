Version 1.1
===========

New features:
* Allow short-hand notation for predicate functions, e.g.
  `ensure(1:10, is.integer)` is equivalent to
  `ensure(1:10, is.integer(.))`.
* New function `check_that` which works like `ensure_that` but returns
  `TRUE`/`FALSE`.


Technical adjustments
* The `value.` argument is renamed to `.` for consistency.
* `ensure_that` can be imported without the need to also import
  `ensures_that`.
